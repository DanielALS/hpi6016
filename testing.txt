Testing process
===============

Initial testing uses the hpisim3.py software device simulation.
Repeat for both Original FW and Integrated Dose modes

# Start IOC after simulation is running.

=== Value tests ===

# Step simulation dose rates from -0.05 through 8388607 mR/h (0x7fffff)
## verify that $(P)DoseRate-I gives the same value +-0.005

# Change simulation alarm levels
## verify that $(P)Lvl:*-I PVs change accordingly.

# For both low and high alarm levels.  Set simulation dose rate to level + 0.01.
## Verify that $(P)Alrm:Low/High-Sts alarms become active.
    When over the low limit only $(P)Alrm:Low-Sts is active.  When over high limit,
    both are active.
## Verify $(P)Alarm:Sum-Sts signals appropriate severity (MINOR for low and MAJOR for high)

# Return the dose rate to 0
## Verify that alarms clear

# Reduce simulation dose rate to -0.05
## Verify that the fail holdoff counter begins counting down
## Verify that $(P)Alrm:Fail-Sts becomes active when the counter reaches zero.

# Return the dose rate to 0
## Verify that $(P)Alrm:Fail-Sts clears
## Verify that the fail holdoff counter returns to its initial value (eg. 60)

# Step simulation dose rates from 0 through 0xffffff
## When in Original FW mode this should have no effect
## In Integrated Dose mode, verify that $(P)Dose-I gives a matching value

# For both Dose and Dose Buck Oflow alarms, set simulated dose to level + 0.01 (5mR for Dose and 45mR for Buck Oflow)
   When in Original FW mode this should have no effect
## Verify that $(P)Alrm:Dose-Sts is active at 5.01
## Verify that $(P)Alrm:Dose-Sts and $(P)Alrm:BuckOflow-Sts are active active at 45.01
## Verify $(P)Alarm:Sum-Sts signals appropriate severity (MAJOR)
## Return simulated dose to 0 and verify that alarms clear

# Check HPV Test Fail
## Verify that $(P)Alrm:Pulse-Sts becomes active

# Uncheck HPV Test Fail
## Verify that $(P)Alrm:Pulse-Sts clears.

# When in Original FW mode
## Verify that $(P)Lvl:Low-I and $(P)Lvl:High-I immediately show the correct value on connection.

# When in Integrated Dose mode
## Wait for $(P)Num:EEBytes-I==255
## Verify that $(P)Lvl:Low-I and $(P)Lvl:High-I show the correct values
## Verify that all EEPROM values are displayed correctly.

=== Dose sum test ===

# Set simulation dose rate to 1 mR/h and restart IOC to clear dose sums.
## When $(P)Cnt:1mTot-I reaches 60 verify that $(P)Dose:1m-I reads 0.017 mR
## When $(P)Cnt:5mTot-I reaches 300 verify that $(P)Dose:5m-I reads 0.083 mR
## When $(P)Cnt:1hTot-I reaches 3600 verify that $(P)Dose:1h-I reads 1.0 mR
## When $(P)Cnt:1dTot-I reaches 86400 verify that $(P)Dose:1d-I reads 24.0 mR
## Verify that all $(P)Cnt:*Bad-I read 0.

=== Communication tests ===

# Stop simulation.
## Verify immediate disconnect and comm alarms when simulation stops.
## Verify that data update counter stops incrementing
## Verify that the following PVs immediately show an INVALID alarm
  $(P)DoseRate-I
  all $(P)Alrm:*-Sts  (except $(P)Alrm:Comm-Sts)
  all $(P)Lvl:*-I
## Verify that the following PVs immediately show an MAJOR alarm
  $(P)Connect-Sts
  $(P)Valid-Sts
  $(P)Alrm:Comm-Sts
  $(P)Msg-I
##After 60 seconds verify that $(P)Dose:1m-I shows an INVALID alarm
   and $(P)Cnt:1mTot-I == $(P)Cnt:1mBad-I

# Re-start simulation (ensure correct FW mode is selected)10
## Verify reconnection.  Alarms should clear and data update counter should resume counting
## Repeat Value tests

# Stop both simulation and IOC.  Start IOC only.
## Verify INVALID and MAJOR alarms are active as in previous step.

# Start simulation
## Verify that alarms clear and update counter starts incrementing.
## Repeat Value tests

# Check Pause Tx
## Verify that update counter stops immediately
## After timeout period (eg 10 sec.) verify that INVALID and MAJOR alarms
  are active as in previous step.
## Verify that $(P)Connect-Sts alarm clears with each successful connection,
  and becomes active again with each subsequent timeout.  Observe at least 3 cycles.

# Uncheck Pause Tx
## Verify that alarms clear and update counter starts incrementing.
## Repeat Value tests

# Click Inject fault at random for some time.  Vary rate.
## Verify that alarms except $(P)Connect-Sts become active

# Stop clicking Inject fault
## Verify that alarms clear and normal operation resumes.
## Repeat Value tests

# Check Pause Tx, then begin slowing clicking Inject byte at least once, but no more than 20 times, per timeout period.  Repeat at least 3 times.
## Verify that alarms except $(P)Connect-Sts become active within 1 timeout period.

# Uncheck Pause Tx
## Verify that alarms clear and update counter starts incrementing.
## Repeat Value tests


=== Bench test with real device ===

# Power ARM then start IOC
## Run Value tests

# Disconnect Ethernet cable and wait for timeout.
## Verify alarms

# Reconnect Ethernet cable
## Verify recovery

# Remove power from ARM
## Verify alarms

# Power on ARM
## Verify recovery
